About the challenge
A hackathon combining Foru.ms (headless backend) and v0 by Vercel (generative frontend).

Choose Your Challenge
Pick a track that matches your skills and interests. Each track offers unique opportunities to showcase your creativity.

🎨 Bring Your Own Head
Front-end Focus
Since we are headless, we need to populate an ecosystem of starter kits. Build the wildest, fastest, or most beautiful front-end using existing frameworks.

Example Ideas:

Swipe-left/swipe-right interface for browsing threads

Retro CLI forum via terminal

React Native or Flutter mobile app

Blazing fast Next.js or SvelteKit template

Open-source repo templates for our docs

🔌 Embedded Community
Integrations
Forums rarely exist in a vacuum—they live inside other products. Integrate Foru.ms seamlessly into an existing platform or type of software.

Example Ideas:

Comment section plugin for static blogs (Gatsby/Hugo)

Customer support ticketing system

Shopify integration for product reviews

SaaS dashboard feedback widget

Prove our API is easy to weave into existing stacks

⚡ AI & Intelligence
LLM-Powered Features
Our API data is incredibly easy to pipe into LLMs. Enhance community interaction using AI.

Example Ideas:

"TL;DR Bot" that summarizes long threads

Sentiment moderation for toxic content

"Matchmaker" algorithm for thread suggestions

Semantic search based on meaning, not keywords

High virality—AI projects get shared widely

🚀 Un-Forum
Creative Misuse
Prove that our data structure (Users → Threads → Posts) is flexible enough to run things that aren't forums.

Example Ideas:

Collaborative storytelling app (posts = chapters)

Specialized job board

Q&A platform (StackOverflow clone)

Changelog/roadmap tool for software companies

For indie hackers wanting a backend-in-a-box

🔧 Migration & Utility
Data Tools
Build tools that make moving data easier and visualizing community health possible.

Example Ideas:

 

"Discourse to Foru.ms" importer script

Discord channel archiver for searchable forums

Analytics dashboards for community growth

Vital tooling for adoption
