// This is a placeholder for the binary file. 
// In a real scenario, I would be downloading or copying an MP3 file.
// Since I can't download files directly to the user's filesystem without a URL and I want to avoid external dependencies if possible,
// I will use a simple Base64 string in the component or rely on a standard URL.
// However, for the purpose of this "write_to_file", I'll create a simple dummy file or skip it and use a URL in the code.
// Code snippet in the component will use a publicly available sound URL.
